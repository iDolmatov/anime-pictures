How do I delete a picture or why I can not remove it?
Pictures can be removed before they're published by moderators. You can do it by clicking on the small basket icon next to the wallpaper number (№).
After the moderator has verified the image, it can not be deleted.

Shall the banned wallpaper be deleted?
The banned wallpaper won’t be deleted. They’ll stay in order to create an ideal duplicate filtering system in the future.

Why can I upload only 15 pictures?
If your pictures are properly tagged, then they should be approved quicker by the moderators. You can ask any moderator to increase your limit.

Why do you limit the downloading of images?
Restrictions introduced to users who are poorly tagging their pictures, or do not tag them at all.

How fast are moderators checking wallpapers?
It primarily depends on presence of the basic tag set.
Properly tagged wallpapers are usually checked within 2-3 days.
Checking of wallpapers without basic tag set depends on the availability and work capacity of the moderators.
Wallpapers without tags are being sent to the TagMe zone, where they stay until the uploader or any other registered user adds the basic tag set.

What is a basic tag set?
1) The title of the manufacturer (of anime, manga or game) or “original” tag if the picture is an artist’s work of authorship.
2) Names of characters.
3) The name of the author.
4) Gender.
5) The color of eyes and hair color.
6) Hair length.
7) The basic clothing elements.
8) The basic background elements.

What is upscale?
Upscale - this is a hardware resolution increase, often leading to a deterioration of image quality.

How can I highlight new anime\character\author tags?
This is done by moderators. Write the name of the anime\character\author's website (in English) in comment, and when wallpaper is checked by the moderator, he will set the tag accordingly.

Is it necessary to specify the artist?
Yes, if it's possible.
It’ll help moderators to find the artist, display an original source page and his name (if the author is from pixiv.net).

Because of what I can’t recommend a tag?
You can only recommend the tags from the data base.

When must I set "long hair" tag or "very long hair"?
You put long hair if the hair are knee-long, if they’re longer then it’s very long hair.

Why my uploads with loli tag had their erotic rating changed?
Because of controversial nature of loli content and how it is interpreted by law in many countries, we were required to set any content with loli containing even a minimal amount of erotic context to be visible only to registered users who have specifically allowed viewing of erotic content in settings. This in turn requires such pictures to be specifically tagged as "erotic" or "hard erotic".
Basic principle is that what normally would be tagged as "light erotic", on loli content it needs to be "erotic" and what would normally be "erotic" needs to be tagged as "hard erotic". What was tagged as hard erotic stays unchanged.

Who can I ask about the site?
You can ask in the corresponding topic on forum if it is present, or simply ask any moderator. List of actual moderators on <a href="https://anime-pictures.net/index/about" rel="nofollow">about page</a>.

Where are beautiful wallpapers taken from?
Mainly from pixiv.net and deviantart.com these are the original sources for the most wallpaper and pictures, related to the site theme.

How is the ratio being calculated?
Formula: comments/2 + (walls*k_score)/100.0 + tags*0.25 where comments and score for last month.

How can I organize my favorites?
You can create unlimited number of folders by going into your profile options.
When you create it, you can add any picture to it by going to the post with it, and selecting the appropriate option from the Your favorite menu (that's why it's a menu, not a button).
Each post can be in one folder at a time.
If you want to remove a picture from the folder, but leave it in favorites, select Add to favorites.
Removing a folder containing pictures will not remove them from your favorites. (by deFco247)

How can I help site?
It's possible on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=8248400" rel="nofollow">Patreon</a>

Why can’t I search pictures by several tags in the "All tags" zone?
"All tags" zone is a data base of all the tags of the site, it’s possible to search just one tag only there, not several tags or pictures.

How can I search wallpaper by several tags at once?
Logical OR:|| (to search for mutiple tags)
Logical AND: &&

An example of a query with ||:
rosario+vampire||striped
will search for pictures that have been tagged "rosario+vampire", "striped", or both of them.

An example of a query with &&:
2girls&&breasts
will search for all pictures that have both "2girls" and "breasts" tags.

You can also combine || and &&, where AND operator && has higher priority.
A&&B||C will be evaluated as A && ( B || C )

Example:
2girls&&rosario+vampire||striped
will search for all pictures that have "2girls" tag and either "rosario+vampire", "striped", or both.
